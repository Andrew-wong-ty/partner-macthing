Given n men and m women(usually, n!=m), find a suitable matching pair. We call it partner matching. This is usually used in social Apps. There are many partner matching activities at University (as far as we know), participants need to fill a certain form, which contains their interests and anticipation for their partner, etc. Occasionally, these forms will be checked by the staff and they will find suitable partner pairs one by one,  which is energy-consuming and exhausting. However,  this process is mechanical. This is because the staffs usually use keywords to match partners. We may use NLP to handle the task.....
